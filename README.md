## Environment ðŸŒŽ
Our Connect 4 game is using the mainstream rules of a Connect 4, this is a two players games where each player can place one coin in the column of their choice in turn. The goal is to **align four** of your coins along the **horizontal axis**, **the vertical axis** or on **any diagonal** of the grid. The little twist of our project is that it is **adaptable to any grid size** with the constraint of the number of columns and lines being at least 4.


This projet was realized for the 1st year course **"Introduction to AI and data science"** of *Ecole Superieur LÃ©onard de Vinci (ESILV)*.
