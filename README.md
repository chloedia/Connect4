## Environment ðŸŒŽ
  Our Connect 4 game is using the mainstream rules of a Connect 4, this is a two players games where each player can place one coin in the column of their choice in turn. The goal is to **align four** of your coins along the **horizontal axis**, **the vertical axis** or on **any diagonal** of the grid. The little twist of our project is that it is **adaptable to any grid size** with the constraint of the number of columns and lines being at least 4.

This projet was realized for the 1st year course **"Introduction to AI and data science"** of *Ecole Superieur LÃ©onard de Vinci (ESILV)*.

## Implementation ðŸ§ 
**AI Rules**
Possible actions : $A = {1,2, ..., n_columns}$
Rewards : **Win** = + 1000 - depth ; **Loss** = - 1000 + depth

**MinMax algorithm**

  The MinMax algorithm is well know in **Game theory**, to describe it rapidly we can stick it to the Connect 4 which is a sequential game meaning that at each step (the player plays a coin) there is a new state. Hence, the goal of the minmax algorithm is simply to find the move that will **maximize your possible reward and next step maximize the possible reward of the oppenent** (So minimize yours). To do so, it will iterate threw all your possible actions and go on on multiple steps that we wll call depth until reaching eather a final reward or a maximum depth.
To optimize the algorithm, we also use the alpha beta pruning method to stop predicting for actions that are considered too bad.

**Heuristic**

As the board can provide too many possibilities of actions, the time complexity for the MiniMax algorithm is too high and we are forced to use an **heuristic**. An heuristic is simply a score that you give to a given state of the game, this is what the minimax will compute after diving on a defined depth. We chose quite a simple to compute heuristic a we use an evaluation grid which is fixed at the begining of the game and depends on the size of the grid. Each cell is assigned a value which corresponds to the number of possible alignments it is oppened to, for exemple :
